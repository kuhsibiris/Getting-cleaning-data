# getting-cleaning-data

This project contains the script run_analysis.R that has the code that turns the given data set
into a tidy one and takes the mean across variables grouped by individual and activity.

The code in run_analysis.R is commented and explains where in the code it fulfills the requirements

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The codebooks is in codebook_total_Base.md and codebook_activity_mean_subject.md.
